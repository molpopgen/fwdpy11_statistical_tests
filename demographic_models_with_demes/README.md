# Description

Statistical tests of simple demographic scenarios defined using [`demes`](https://github.com/popsim-consortium/demes-python).
The models are built using the `fwdpy11` object interface.
The test is to plot the average frequency spectrum for each model and compare to [`moments`](https://moments.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
The final report also contains a plot of the demographic model using [`demesdraw`](https://github.com/grahamgower/demesdraw), which is a bit risky as that package may have API changes.
